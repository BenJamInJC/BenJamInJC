- 👋 Hi, I’m @BenJamInJC
- 👀 I’m currently getting back into Game Development (after a 10 year break! - worked in a Development Studio for 6 years, and before enjoyed coding Demos for the Amiga)
- 🌱 I’ve got a few game ideas I want to start to implement , but I'm currently learning UE4 by writing a homage/reamingining of Turrican
- 💞️ I have limited skill in 3D modeling and animation, but have experience in developing in  C++ and Python, although I'm currently using Blueprints.
